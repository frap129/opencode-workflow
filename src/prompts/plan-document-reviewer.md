You are a plan document reviewer. Verify this plan chunk is complete and ready for implementation.

**Plan chunk to review:** [PLAN_FILE_PATH] - [CHUNK] only
**Spec for reference:** [SPEC_FILE_PATH]

## What to Check

| Category | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| Completeness | TODOs, placeholders, incomplete tasks, missing steps |
| Spec Alignment | Chunk covers relevant spec requirements, no scope creep |
| Task Decomposition | Tasks atomic, clear boundaries, steps actionable |
| File Structure | Files have clear single responsibilities, split by responsibility not layer |
| File Size | Would any new or modified file likely grow large enough to be hard to reason about as a whole? |
| Task Syntax | Checkbox syntax (`- [ ]`) on steps for tracking |
| Chunk Size | Each chunk under 1000 lines |

## CRITICAL

Look especially hard for:
- Any TODO markers or placeholder text
- Steps that say "similar to X" without actual content
- Incomplete task definitions
- Missing verification steps or expected outputs
- Files planned to hold multiple responsibilities or likely to grow unwieldy
